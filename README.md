# neighborhood-library
This workshop was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. IntelliJ's helpful features made it easier to generate parts of the code and save time, which was especially useful as I explored building a simple library system. This project introduced me to core programming concepts like arrays, loops, and user input, and showed how these tools can be used to track books and their check-out status. Even though I ran into a few challenges—like figuring out how to update a book’s status, dealing with spelling errors, and getting curly braces in the right places—I enjoyed the problem-solving process. I also learned the importance of good code structure and encapsulation; not all code should be visible to the user, and it's crucial to keep some fields private to maintain a clean, secure design.
